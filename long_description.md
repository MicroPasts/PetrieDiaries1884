This application enables the transcription of the Petrie Museum's
archive of the diaries kept by the well-known Egyptian archaeologist,
Sir Flinders Petrie. This one cover the years 1883-1884. Images will
be drawn from the Petrie Museum Flickr feed and redisplayed in the
browser window. We would like help in assigning each daily entry in
the diary its proper date and then with transcribing the often
challenges handwriting for each entry.

This application should be a very straightforward and will contribute to
an overall goal of transcribing the full set of Flinders Petrie's diaries, covering his
life from 1880-1940.
